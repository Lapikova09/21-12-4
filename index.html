            <p>“Lorem Ipsum” is a truncated and often altered section of a Latin text taken from “De finibus bonorum et malorum “, a work by the Roman orator Cicero written in 45 BC. The work deals with the theory of ethics. The specific passage from which “Lorem Ipsum ” is derived roughly translates to something dealing with pain and pleasure.</p>

                <h4>Why do we use it?</h4>

            </div>
            <p>Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.</p>

            <p>To a degree, Lorem Ipsum is gibberish, but it is rooted in a real language: Latin. The text’s origins are based on a passage from a piece of classical Latin literature dating back to 45 BC. That means that Lorem Ipsum is more than 2,000 years old! To get specific, Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (On the Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero.</p>
